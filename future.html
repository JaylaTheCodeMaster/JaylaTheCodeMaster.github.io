        <p> One of my highschool  choices are Lakewood Highschool. If I were to go to Lakewood, I would 
    choose DMAC as my pathway. The reason for this is because I really like photography. Another
    school of choice would be Millikan Highschool. I would do the program Millikan Compass. I
    would do Millikan Compass for art and photography. Since i enjoy baking and cooking, my final choice 
    would be Browning for their Culinary Arts program. </p>
